# C Programming Portfolio: Logic & System Architecture

Welcome to my code archive. 🚀

This repository is not just a collection of assignments; it is the chronological documentation of my journey into low-level programming. I use this space to push my code **every single day**, moving from basic logic building to complex memory management and system design.

I believe that to be a great backend engineer in Java, one must first understand how memory works in C.

## 🗺️ The Repository Map (Navigation)
Since I archive my code chronologically by module, use this guide to find the advanced concepts:

### 🏆 Top Tier: Projects & Architecture
If you only have time to look at a few things, start here. These demonstrate my ability to build complete systems.

| Folder Name | Topic | Why it matters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Book Management System** | **File I/O** | Persistent data storage and retrieval system. |
| **Assignment 13** | **Malloc/Calloc** | **Dynamic Memory Allocation**. Manual heap management. |
| **Assignment 7** | **Pointers** | Direct memory access and address manipulation. |

### 📂 Core Logic & Data Handling
The building blocks of my algorithmic foundation.

| Folder | Concept Covered |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Assignment 14-15** | **Structures (Structs)** - Grouping complex data types (The precursor to OOP). |
| **Assignment 10-12** | **String Manipulation** - Custom string parsers and memory buffers. |
| **Assignment 8-9** | **Arrays** - Data storage and retrieval algorithms. |
| **Assignment 6** | **Functions** - Modular code and stack management. |
| **Assignment 0-5** | **Logic Building** - Loops, Patterns, and Conditional branching. |

## 🛠️ Technical Focus
* **Language:** ANSI C
* **Key Concepts:** Pointers, Dynamic Memory (DMA), File Handling, Data Structures.
* **Tools:** VS Code, GCC Compiler.
